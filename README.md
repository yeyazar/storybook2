1. Created a React Project
2. Added to Github
3. "Hello World" written but wont matter after Storybook
4. Storybook installed -> then added
5. Storybook tutorial Single Component added

-> will continue with Composite Component soon

Problems:
1. Git first push had errors because first branch is called "main" not "master"
2. Couldnt setup Storybook with its own tutorial, had help from "Blackbox.ai"
